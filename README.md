## How to Use

### Hosted Version
This application is hosted online for immediate use at this [link](dadd0.github.io/eigen-viz/).

### Run Locally
To run the application on your machine:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
2. Install dependencies and activate your virtual environment (e.g., using `uv` or `pip`).
3. Launch the interactive notebook:

```bash
marimo edit eigenvalues-eigenvectors.py
```

## Features

- 🚀 **Visualize** eigenvalues and eigenvectors for custom matrices
- 🎨 **Interactive** matrix editor with real-time updates
- 📊 **Dynamic plots** for geometric interpretation

## Motivation

Created to bridge the gap between theory and intuition. While many resources explain the math, Eigen-Viz lets you *see* how linear transformations work.
